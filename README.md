Hemnet commute time
======

This is a Google Chrome extension for Hemnet. It allows to display the commute time between a place of interest and each of the Hemnet search result.

Configure your places of interest and your Google Maps API key in ```content.js````.

Get your API key on https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key.

Improvements
------

- Only the first route from Google Maps API is processed. Some kind of averaging could be used.
